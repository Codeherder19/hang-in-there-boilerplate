## Instructions for running/viewing the project:
Find the link to the test site below! Upon load, you should see a randomly-generated motivational poster which is comprised of an image, a title, and a quote. The page also includes 4 buttons: **Save This Poster**, **Show Saved Posters**, **Show Another Random Poster**, and **Make Your Own Poster**! You can click on **Show Another Random Poster** to make the page generate another random poster and display it on this page! The **Make Your Own Poster** button takes you to a form with three input fields (of an image, title and quote again) which allow you to make your own poster! Feel free to use one of the images provided below to start making your own poster here! The *Show my poster* button generates the poster based on your inputs, and the *Nevermind, take me back!* button brings you back to the main view if you don't actually want to make a custom poster. You want to `Copy Image Address` to get the working address. On the main view, click the **Save This Poster** button to save whichever poster is currently showing, whether a random poster or YOUR poster! Then simply click on **Show Saved Posters** to see a gallery-view of user-generated and random posters alike!

*easily print a saved poster from the application directly*
*change default font or coloring*

### Wins:

  * **event.preventDefault()**
  * **successful refactoring of function using toggle method to add and remove the hidden class**
  * **gained a strong proficiency writing query selector and event listeners**

### Challenges:
  * getting saved posters to display in grid with desired CSS styling
  * asking for help when stumped for too long, such as with learning event.preventDefault()
  * needed to reexamine DTR due to unexpected life events
  * spending more time using Divide and Conquer method than our chosen method of pair programming
